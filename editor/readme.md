Finally switched from Vim to Spacemacs
---------
I spent far too long tweaking my vimrc -- trying to pull haphazardly from others' vim configs and ignorantly fiddling with vimscript -- only to get a really subpar environment. Spacemacs gives you the maneuverability of vim, the power of emacs, and nearly the ease-of-config of VsCode. I'm really loving it thus far.
