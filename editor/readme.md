# My take on the Editor War
Which editor you choose has been a hot topic for time immemorial, with staunch supporters on all side. For most who subscribe to Hacker culture, using the "opposing" editors is considered infidelity.\

Personally, I'm not super opinionated on my editor. I'm comfortable as long as I have Vim keybinds, syntax highlighting, and language server integrations. I currently use NeoVim the most, followed by spacemacs, then VSCode. I used to hate on VSCode heavy for being a Microsoft product, but honestly it has some nice extensions (e.g. remote-containers).
