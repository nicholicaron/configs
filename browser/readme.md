Firefox
----------
I use Firefox (big s/o to Mozilla), and really love how much you can customize it. I have my search bar/tabs at the bottom,
and automatically invert colors in the pdf reader as a sort of makeshift dark-reader

**A note on Security:** I recommend hardening firefox using this [hardening config](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js).
Also, there are some really great plugins available for security and accessibility.
